# scripts

Currently only two files in here but more in progress.

Current files are as described below
1. Remove Slash R
   Description: The only really complete and full script. Takes one file and removes any \r characters that Windows sometimes produces when modifying files.

2. ucoSSH
   Description: Currently in progress but I'm open to help. Connects to the University of Central Oklahoma's cs server with credentials you save on your device.
